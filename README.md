AndroidAppConfigBackup
======================


Description
=====================
I want to make a common lib to backup/recovery the Android App data.

The data path mostly is:/data/data/app.packagename/.

Backup the data to the sdcard

 
Feature in mind
=====================
1.Create a lib that will be used in another Android project.

2.The backup data will be stored/parsed with XML format.

3.Support file encryption.

4.Support file compress with zip format.


Backup config XML
